### CPSC 120

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-shreyas-and-isaiah.git)

    Lab 5, part 3 was a lab exercise that I have a fond memory of. I remember being very proud with the outcome especially after learning what the blackjack game was. I felt a though I had mastered if statements and the logic behind them. 

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-shreyas-anthony-jazmine.git)

    Lab 8, part 2 was another lab exercise I learned a lot from. This exercise taught me the skill of patience. I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to work it and this was mainly due to my lack of knowledge in how to use files in C++. After I solved it I felt a great sense of relief and I further read about text files.

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-shreyas-and-lesly-2.git)

    Lab 12, part 2 was an exercise which intrigued me the most. This exercise gave me more confidence in making functions as well as a better idea about header files. This lab also gave me more exposure on how to use random numbers in C++.
